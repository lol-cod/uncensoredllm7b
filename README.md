Introduction:
Hugging Face, a prominent platform in the field of natural language processing, provides a wide array of powerful language models. In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to download the uncensored version of the WizardLM-7B model and leverage it locally for creative tasks.

Step 1: Navigate to Hugging Face
Visit Hugging Face’s website to discover a wealth of pre-trained language models.


Step 2: Select Your Model
Choose a model based on your preference. For this tutorial, we’ll be using the uncensored version of the WizardLM-7B model from TheBloke’s repository. Download the model file, ensuring to store it in a folder named “models.”



Step 3: Install Required Python Modules
Open your command line interface and install the necessary Python modules using the following command:

pip install pathlib2
pip install json
pip install IPython
pip install llama_cpp
Step 4: Create a Python Script
Now, let’s create a Python script with the provided code. Make sure to replace <path_to_model> with the actual path to the downloaded model.

from llama_cpp import Llama
from IPython.display import display, HTML
import json
import time
import pathlib

LLM = Llama(model_path="./<path_to_model>", n_ctx=2048)
prompt = "Q: "Your Query" A:"
output = LLM(prompt)
print(output["choices"][0]["text"])
Feel free to modify the code according to your preferences.

Step 5: Run the Script
Execute the Python script. Keep in mind that this is a small model, and it requires a minimum of 8GB of RAM to run efficiently.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you’ve successfully downloaded the uncensored version of the WizardLM-7B model from Hugging Face and integrated it into a local Python script. This opens up a world of possibilities for creative natural language processing tasks. Experiment with different prompts and unleash the full potential of this powerful language model. Happy coding!
